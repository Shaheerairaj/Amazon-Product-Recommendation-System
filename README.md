# Masters in Data Analytics Capstone

This repository contains all materials used to establish my Capstone project for my Masters in Data Analytics.
This project focuses on creating a recommendation system using the Amazon Reviews dataset by using 7 different machine learning techniques and making a comparison of the 2.

The rest of the folders are there incase I decide to use other datasets incase Amazons isn't enough.
